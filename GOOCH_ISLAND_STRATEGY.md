# Gooch Island (Gonad on Monad) — Launch Strategy

Goal: Capture attention during Monad launch with a parody-forward teaser site that funnels visitors into a whitelist and social loop, leading into a mint window.

## Positioning
- We are an NFT collection (not an L1), leaning into parody: “Gonad on Monad.”
- Tone: irreverent, juvenile, crypto-native. A wink at Monad’s polish with our chaotic energy.
- Core identity: Gooch Island — a cursed paradise where testnet energy meets testicle energy.

## Phased Plan
1) Teaser (Week 0–1)
- Landing page: diamond portal + gonad mark; headline: “Gonad on Monad” + “Coming soon.”
- Single CTA: Join Whitelist (wallet + optional email + X/Discord follow hints)
- Add ‘Check whitelist’ flow.
- Social pack: header image, pfp variants, 3–5 meme posts queued.

2) Drip (Week 1–2)
- Post 1–2 lore fragments (“Dispatches from Gooch Island”).
- Reveal 2–3 artworks/frames in short loops.
- Light allowlist quests (like/retweet, join Discord, submit wallet) using form.

3) Preview (T-3 to T-1 days)
- Drop the collection page: supply, mint price range, date/time.
- Trailer GIF/video (15s) featuring the gonad diamond portal.
- Partner shoutouts and mintlist collabs.

4) Mint (T day)
- Inline mint widget when ready; otherwise link to marketplace partner.
- Live updates: minted X/Y, recent mints ticker.

## On-Site Features (MVP)
- Whitelist modal (wallet + optional email). Persist to localStorage and POST to API (stub now).
- Whitelist check: input wallet → “You’re in” / “Not yet.”
- Social footer: X + Discord.
- Analytics: simple pageview + CTA click tracking (stub).

## Copy Direction (Hero)
- Title: “Gonad on Monad.”
- Subtitle (rotating):
  - “Coming soon to a bag near you.”
  - “One chain. Two balls. Infinite goo.”
  - “Speed without shrinkage.”
- Body: “Gooch Island is an NFT collection launching on Monad. It’s stupid. It’s beautiful. You’re invited.”
- CTA: Join Whitelist / Check Status.

## Metrics
- WL signups, social growth (X/Discord), email captures.
- Engagement on teaser posts.

## Risks
- Over-parody; keep a clean mint-experience path.
- Timing drift vs Monad announcements; keep copy generic until date locks.

## Next
- Build WhitelistDialog and wire into Header/Hero.
- Swap hero copy to collection-centric.
- Prep social assets.
