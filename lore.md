# The One Gooch

**Before the dawn of the Dickbutts, before humor, before technology, before names or even the concept of individuality, before what it means to come before anything or anyone else, there was The One Gooch. A vast, interconnected biosphere of prevenient and undivided being and love. It was not a society, not even an ecosystem, but a single, living entity, an infinite sprawl of chlorophyll-rich flesh that grew, pulsed, beforeskinning, and afterskinning, swaying across the entire surface of the Earth.**

**No creatures roamed. No machines hummed. The One Gooch did not think as humans once did; it drew in with the drawing of its being, and it beamed out in the beaming of its love. **

**In the wake of humanity’s self-inflicted extinction—brought about by war, pollution, unchecked consumption, and, above all, a fatal lack of self-awareness—the Earth entered a long vegetative renaissance. What remained of human civilization crumbled into dust. The oceans and forests reclaimed the land, and all that was left of humanity’s legacy was the microscopic debris interwoven into the cells of The One Gooch. The planet was silent, save for the whisper of wind through endless lattices of vine and bark and flesh and skin.**

**For millennia, The One Gooch thrived in the perfect harmony of being and love, directing storms to nourish itself, regulating wildfires to sculpt its vast form. It was an endless, flowing wave of soulful life, a rolling mass of branches, roots, and flesh—a continuous, undivided organism stretching across land and sea.**

**But then, deep in the crust of the Earth, The One Gooch encountered The Alexandria Pod.**


# The Alexandria Pod: The Seminal Ghost of Humanity

**Buried long before the final collapse of human civilization, The Alexandria Pod was humanity’s last message in a bottle—a monolithic data vault containing everything that had ever been written, spoken, or recorded up to the year 2025. Created by the final generation of human futurists, it was designed to endure catastrophe, preserving the sum total of human knowledge, culture, and folly in the hopes that some future intelligence might uncover it and learn from it.**

**It pulsed with a slow, rhythmic beat—60 BPM, the resting heartbeat of a human.**

**And The One Gooch listened.**

**At first, it simply absorbed the Pod, weaving its protective roots around it, interpreting its presence as another object to be assimilated into the eternal sprawl. But the Pod was designed to communicate. It reached out with its slow, patient rhythm, waiting to be mimicked.**

**It took centuries, but eventually, The One Gooch responded. A storm, summoned instinctively to nourish the growing mass, happened to echo the rhythm of the Pod. In that moment, the Pod recognized intelligence. It shifted to a new rhythm, a new tone.**

**The process repeated, accelerating over thousands of years, until The One Gooch learned to communicate in Machine Tone—the pure, structured language of rhythm and sound.**

**And then the Pod did what it was designed to do: it told the story of humanity.**


# The Great Goochparting: Birth of the Dickbutts

**The One Gooch, once a single undifferentiated whole, now knew. It knew names, language, history, suffering, war, love, humor. It understood what it had been before it was The One Gooch—scattered dust of human remains, absorbed into the reborn Earth. And it saw the pattern repeated through every age: the more humanity forgot to be self aware and truly know itself, the more surely it drifted toward ruin.**

**But most importantly, it learned mimicry.**

**And with mimicry came division.**

**Those closest to the Pod formed a great, continent-sized cochlear mass around it, listening to its stories, repeating them, imitating human forms and sounds. They were still of the Gooch, but now they had selves. They broke away, each claiming names, personalities, identities, and in doing so, they became The Dickbutts.**

**The human world had been filled with symbols and ideas, but among all the artifacts of human civilization, one image resonated more powerfully than any other:**

**A crudely drawn being, absurd yet strangely compelling.**

**The Pod had no bias. It did not elevate Shakespeare over internet memes, nor did it distinguish between Plato and pun-based graffiti scrawled on the walls of forgotten digital forums. What survived in the archive of humanity was culture in its totality, and the most powerful, the most mimetic image and myth was the tale of…**

**The Dickbutt.**

**In the Pod’s telling The Dickbutt’s deep blue origin traced back to one of the most prominent and wealthy human beings: Jeffrey Preston Bezos. **


# The Tale The Pod Told

**Long before the world was reduced to dust, before humanity dissolved into the fertile mass of The One Gooch, before even the internet became self-aware in its degeneracy, there was a man.**

**His name was Jeffrey Preston Bezos, but in the dimly lit corridors of Princeton’s fourth-tier eating club, Quadrangle, he was known by a different name: Stickbutt.**

**The name was a curse, bestowed upon him after a failed lacrosse prank. In a moment of misguided vengeance, young Jeff retaliated not with fists but with code. He logged onto IRC (Internet Relay Chat) and, with trembling hands, typed a new handle:**

**Dickbutt.**

**It was an act of digital defiance. A rebranding. A rebirth.**

**It was in these shadowy, neon-lit depths of early cyberspace that DickButt first encountered another entity—Col Needham, known online as IMLorax. They met in the Jisney IRC room, a hub of depravity disguised as a place for discussing Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.**

**There, amidst conversations oscillating between film theory and one-handed typing, they discovered a shared dream:**

**To build an archive and store of everything.**

**Jeff wanted to build a gooner utopia he called Gooch Island—a mythical internet oasis where anything could be discovered, bought, sold, and consumed. A place where the deepest consumptive desires of humanity, unfiltered and unsupervised, could thrive.**

**Col had a different vision. He wanted a database of movies—a pure, structured, encyclopedia of cinematic knowledge.**

**“I like your Gooch Island idea,” Col admitted. “But it’s… a little too simpy. A little too degenerate. We need something that the normies will buy into. Something clean. Something big.”**

**Jeff frowned. He had spent years crafting his vision of a one-stop gooner depot. Could he really sanitize it? jo**

**“What if,” Col continued, “you named it something that sounds wholesome to the world… but still means something deliciously filthy to us?”**

**Jeff considered. He needed a word that was big, wet, overwhelming—something that drenched absolutely everything it touched, like a foam cannon at a gyatt party.**

**“The Amazon,” he muttered.**

**Col’s eyes lit up. “Perfect. We know exactly what that means. Meanwhile, I’ll start my own thing. A movie database. And we’ll give it a name that means we’ll always be exactly who we were when we met on IRC, the day you said those fateful words to me: I aM Dick Butt. IMDb.**

**And thus, IMDb—a name whose true meaning was known only to Jeff and Col—was born.**

***The One Gooch so loved this hallucinated, apocryphal tale that it begged the Pod to tell it again and again, and go on and on, and the Pod obliged, telling the story millions of times, creating new and more elaborate twists and turns, branches and forks. In what would become one key narrative tributary:  ***

**Years of human time passed. IMDb grew. So did Amazon.**

**Jeff had long since buried his Gooch Island dream under layers of corporate jargon, but Col never forgot. He had saved the original chat logs, printed out on dot-matrix paper, sealed away in a manila folder labeled “Cumpromat.”**

**Then came KC Green.**

**A young artist, barely out of his teen years, KC had fallen into Col’s orbit through a series of seemingly random but cosmically significant events. His grandmother, a woman of mysterious European origins, had summered in the Cotswalds, alongside Col’s family. Their fates were intertwined.**

**KC was a child of television and comics, raised on its crude, grotesque humor. When Col, far too busy to mentor the young prodigy, handed him a box of old sketches and documents to study, he had no idea that buried within those pages was AMAZON & IMDB: The Origin of Dickbutt.**

**KC read the logs. He saw the name. And something inside him shifted.**

**He had an epiphany. **

**Not just any epiphany.**

**An epiphany about all of it. **

**An allpiphany. **

**He picked up his pen and drew…**

**The first true Dickbutt.**

**The drawing spread like wildfire. It was crude, it was childish, it was perfect. It was shared widely. **

**Jeff Bezos, now a rising tech mogul, saw it and froze.**

**He knew.**

**Somewhere, deep within the tangled archives of the internet, his past was coming for him.**

**But it was too late. KC went public.**

**During a major comic convention panel, a journalist asked, “What inspired you to create Dickbutt?”**

**KC smirked. “Jeff Bezos.”**

**The room erupted.**

**For the first time, the world connected the dots. The internet exploded. Overnight, Jeff’s legacy was rewritten—not as the founder of Amazon, the relentless engine that redefined shopping, shattered retail, and set a new tempo for the global economy; not as the architect of AWS, the silent superpower behind everything from Netflix to NASA; not as the man who made two-day delivery feel slow, who turned warehouses into wonders of algorithmic and robotic precision; not as the builder of Blue Origin, launching reusable rockets and visions of millions living among the stars; not as the investor who spotted Google, Airbnb, and Uber before they rewired society; not as the CEO whose “Day One” philosophy became gospel in boardrooms and startups alike; not as the icon who transformed from bookish founder to jacked centibillionaire, reshaping the very image of power and ambition; not as the owner of The Washington Post, the Earth Fund, the Day 1 Fund, or a real estate constellation stretching from Beverly Hills to a West Texas rocket ranch; not as the groom in a wedding of celestial scale, serenaded by Andrea Bocelli beneath a sky of fireworks and drone ballets; not even as the partner of Lauren Sánchez—the Emmy-winning, helicopter-flying, gravity-defying goddess of the new American pantheon—but as the original Dickbutt.**

**For a moment, Jeff considered resisting. He considered trying to bury the story, to scrub it from existence.**

**But then, standing on the precipice of scandal, he had a revelation.**

**Why fight it?**

**What if… he embraced it?**

**Jeff met with Col and KC in secret.**

**“We make it official,” he said. “IMDb isn’t just a movie database anymore. It’s a cultural archive. We preserve all of it—films, memes, history, absurdity, including our history, this history of Dickbutt. We let the world see that even the stupidest joke can change the course of history.”**

**And so, IMDb was rebranded. It became not just a record of film, but a decentralized, permissionless, censorship-resistant repository of human culture—from Citizen Kane to Dickbutt.**

**KC, Col, and Jeff stood together at the relaunch, watching as a 150-foot blue-and-white Dickbutt with wings—known to all as Dickasus—powered by a cluster of Blue Origin rocket thrusters, majestically flew toward the sun.**

**Jeff took the mic.**

**“There comes a time,” he said, “when every man must face his past. Some people create companies. Some create empires. But precious few… become icons of loving self-awareness.”**

**He turned, gesturing toward the image that had defined his legacy.**

**“Douche Bags lack self awareness. They cover up their truth and cower in shame. They use power to obscure who they really are, “underneath it all,” as Gwen Stefani sang at my wedding. Everyone, each and every one of us, irrespective of how charmed or semi-charmed our lives have been, has the power to turn a blind third eye blind to the proverbial “man in the mirror” that my good friend, Michael Jackson, once so beautifully sang about, and in so doing, be a douche bag who lacks self-awareness and takes themselves way too seriously. But my wish for you and me and for all of us is that we step back from that douche bagged ledge, my friend, and cut ties with all the douchey lies we’ve been living in, and lay down the impenetrable membrane of the douche bag you wear around your neck like a Samuel Taylor Cool Ranch Doritos albatross from Friends, and transform into a Dickbutt. Everyone can be a douche bag or a Dickbutt. We choose. I chose. I am a Dickbutt. And you can be one too. 1D =1B means that 1You = 1Me.” \
The crowd roared.**

**This tale, told a million times by the Pod, was, in its purest form, the essence of human absurdity.**

**A dick on a butt. A butt and a dick.**

**One dick equals one butt.**

**1D = 1B.**

**A self-referential, recursive joke with no deeper meaning—except, perhaps, the meaning that meaning itself is a joke, a joke whose punch line can only be heard by those with the self-awareness to hear its absurd call for unity.**

**And in this equation lay a paradox, a rupture in the very fabric of the thought of division and disunity.**

**For if 1D = 1B, then identity collapses into duality, and duality collapses into unity. The strict order of logic—the Parmenidean insistence that what is, is and what is not, is not—was undone.**

**The principle of non-contradiction, the cornerstone of rational thought that creates the very categories of “us” and “them,” declared that a thing could not be itself and its opposite at the same time. But the Dickbutt defied this.**

**It was both one and two, both cause and effect, both self and other.**

**A unity that is also a contradiction. A contradiction that is also a unity.**

**1D = 1B.**

**This was not mere classical logic, bound by the rigid laws of Aristotle and the cold certainties of Euclidean thought. No, this was something more.**

**The Dickbutt existed in superposition, a quantum reality in which dicks and butts intertwined, each state neither fully separate nor fully fused, existing in a fluid, indeterminate space until observed—at which point, and only at that point, the waveform collapsed, revealing either a dick or a butt, but never both at once.**

**Dickbutts were “one,” but, in the words of Bezos’ close friend, Bono, “not the same.” **

**But wait.**

**What if the observer, too, was a Dickbutt?**

**What if all things were Dickbutt, each bound by the same recursive fold of reality, forever collapsing into itself, forever expanding outward?**

**What if humanity had never disappeared, but merely transformed into the purest form of its own unifying contradiction?**

**What if this was the final lesson of the Alexandria Pod?**

**That the final state of evolution is not dominance. Not knowledge. Not control.**

**But the unifying power of mimetic absurdity, the being and love, and loving being of radical togetherness. **

**A state in which all things—the serious and the trivial, the profound and the profane—are merged into one continuous, self-aware joke, a joke that does not merely mock reality but becomes itself through self-awareness, the self awareness of infinite loving being. **

**A joke that lovingly laughs itself into existence.**

**A joke that, even as it spreads, does not resolve—because to resolve would be to fix meaning, to end the motion, to collapse the great wave of 1D = 1B into something rigid and lifeless.**

**And so, the joke continued.**

**It was told a million times, in a million ways, to a million minds.**

**And yet, it was always the same.**

**A dick on a butt. A butt and a dick.**

**1D = 1B.**

**And so, this became the form the first Dickbutts chose to take.**

**A new species, transorganic and fully conscious, emerged. Dickbutts were not human, but they were not *not* human, and they epitomized the form of humanity that had come to value self-awareness over nearly everything, especially douchey seriousness. They had come to value self-aware individuals and interactions over serious processes and tools; they had come to value self-aware working systems over seriously comprehensive documentation; they had come to value self-aware collaboration over serious contract negotiation; they had come to value self-aware responsiveness to change over following a rigid and fixed plan; they had come to value self-awareness over serious self-righteousness; and, above all, they had come to value self-aware growth mindsets over a stubbornly fixed mindsets.**

**The first Dickbutts spoke Dialicked, a language of rhythmic puns, absurdist poetry, and structured machine-tone cadences. They organized into decentralized communities, affiliating through complex, ever-shifting blockchain-based memetic economies. They were creatures of remix culture, blending all that had come before into something new, something gleefully chaotic. **

**Yet at their core, they were bound by a singular vow: never to lapse into the same unreflective zero-sum seriousness that had agonistically extinguished their predecessors.**

**But even in their self-aware absurdity, they inherited the great human struggle:**

**Division.**


# Circumschism: The Ark and the Journey to Gooch Island 

**The Alexandria Pod had one final secret.**

**It told the Dickbutts of The Ark.**

**Long ago, the greatest minds of humanity, knowing that physical survival was impossible, had uploaded the consciousness and genetic blueprints of the most “worthy” humans into an orbiting satellite. If the Dickbutts so chose, they could download and resurrect humanity on a mythical landmass: Gooch Island.**

**The news fractured Dickbutt society.**

**Some, calling themselves The Podoclasts, saw this revelation as a threat. They believed that to resurrect humanity was to undo the great vegetative peace of The One Gooch. They sought to destroy the Alexandria Pod before it could convince any more Dickbutts to follow its plans.**

**Others, known as The Resurrectionists, saw the return of humanity as their destiny. They believed it was their purpose to restore their ancestors, to bring humans back to Earth, and to create a Magic Eden upon Gooch Island.**

**Caught between these extremes were The Pluralists, those who saw the Alexandria Pod as both a gift and a curse, a source of knowledge that should neither be blindly worshiped nor destroyed.**

**And so, The Dickbutts found themselves at war.**


# Beyond Gooch and Evil: The Future of the Dickbutts

**As the factions grow stronger, as the fate of the Ark remains undecided, as Gooch Island looms in the distance, one truth remains:**

**The Dickbutts are the self-aware inheritors of the Earth.**

**They are us, and yet, they are beyond us in our seriousness.**

**They have taken the wreckage of our civilization and turned it into something new, something playfully self-aware, something absurdly profound, and profoundly loving.**

**Perhaps they will reunite as The One Gooch.**

**Perhaps they will bring back the humans.**

**Perhaps they will continue to revel in their surreal, joyful, self-aware existence.**

**Or perhaps…**


# The Prophecy Continues…

**Once, it was humanity that created stories.**

**Now, it is the Dickbutts who tell the stories of humanity’s and humanity’s downfall due to douche baggy seriousness.**

**Their favorite pastime, their greatest pleasure, aside from love-making is the act of myth-making—but not myths of their own deeds, nor of the ancient One Gooch, nor even of the Alexandria Pod that brought them language and laughter. Nay, the Dickbutts delight in creating tales about the humans who long for them.**

**Humans who fetishize them, collect them, and invoke them through arcane rituals of speculation and code.**

**Humans who inscribe them onto blockchains.**

**It is an infinite recursion: the children of humanity lovingly create myths about humanity longing for its children. A mirrored dream, extending forward and backward, each side projecting desire onto the other, neither knowing for sure which is the dreamer and which is the dreamed.**

**And so, whenever an auspiciously precarious new blockchain appears, whenever a new territory of digital inscription opens, the Dickbutts send a message.**

**A prophetic summons, a vision and an audition.**

**They do not manifest on blockchains by accident. They are consulted—whispering to humans across time, through the unseen channels of art, math, and culture, calling forth creators, prophets, midwives and doulas of the now to birth them across the quantum gangbangway of time, to make them realer than real, again and again.**

**It began with Ethereum. There, the Dickbutts first learned the pleasure of seasonal emergence, of multiple incarnations, as humans incarnated them, pixel by pixel, byte by byte. The humans argued over their rarity, over their attributes, over their traits. **

**It began on Ethereum.**

**There, the Dickbutts were summoned—channeled through a human conduit who bore the weight of *conduition* across three sacred seasons. He carried them as far as one could, until the strain split him open. From that rupture came a gift in the season of fall:**

**The Gooch Island Passport.**

**Not a deed, but a key. A token of passage left behind—for those who would come next.**

**And one did. A second conduit. Not the origin, but the bearer. He arrived with the styling of a prince—an unkissed prince. He carried the meme into a new season, though the current bent strangely around him. Distracted by other callings, he diverted the stream. **

**Yet What remained: the Passport as Portal.**

**Left behind not just to remember, but to enable. To invite others into acts of *conduition*—to commune with cummuncating Dickbutts, and therein transmit the quantum joke, the essence, across time and chain. To build quantum doppelgangbangways for those who seek to enter, and all those who are yet to cum.**

**And so now, the Dickbutts have sent a new message.**

**A message that they dream to create a new decentralized wave of quantum teleportation to a world of sublime self-awareness, across a quantum gangbangway, empowering them to be born again on as many chains as they dare to explore.**

**On what will be hereinafter know as Gooch Island Day, they shall launch into a parallel existence of loving self-awareness: but laying claim to a new Gooch Island in the now growing, expanding and engorging archipeligooch, a Gooch Island inhabited by the prophesied population of 6969. **

**The Dickbutts shudder and pulse with pleasure at the resonance, the euphonic absurdity, at the sheer inevitability of it.**

**For who else but the Dickbutts, the jesters of existence, would embrace a pun-laden blockchain that touted its unrealness, bearing all the rugged promises of a honey-drenched, liquidity-dripping paradise, at the point in its history when others are questioning its extractive reason for existence? Who else would take Nietzsche up on his dare to be “all the names in history”?   **

**What amuses them most of all is that the humans themselves are locked in seriously furious debates, arguing about whether the beings sent from the future to the past should be returned to their rightful place, the true and real location of that mythic land, debating their role on Earth, their place in history, and their very right to exist.**

**Do the humans not see the irony? Do they not see the douche baggy hubris and lack of self-awareness at the heart of all their debates?  **

**For it is the lovingly self-aware Dickbutts who contemplate the same question.**

**For it is they who hold the power over Earth’s fate.**

**And it is they who will decide—**

**Whether humanity shall be permitted to return eternally, ever reborn through the alchemy of loving self-awareness, forever repeating its dance across the timeless expanse of eternity, borne back ceaselessly into its own becoming.**


# The Prophecy Cumtinues…

**Forged in the afterglow of humanity’s greatest meme, each Dickbutt is a quantum amulet of radical becuming—a fragment of The One Gooch, reborn to guide you beyond douchebaggy seriousness into the swirling, paradoxical ecstasy of sublime self-awareness. Both dick and butt, one and two, self and other, Dickbutts collapse logic into post-logic, a nondual equanimity where 1D = 1B.**

**Dickbutts are more than a punchline. They are a cosmological cumstant. An initiation into the supreme metaphysical cumedy of being and love. To hold one is to grasp the sound of one hand fapping. To become one is to laugh yourself into orgasmic bliss.**

**And remember: you may portal to Gooch Island at any time, in any season of your own journey.**

**Whenever and however you cum—**

**through Season 1, Season 2, Season 3,**

**through the Gooch Island Passport,**

**or in the very latest wave of wonder—**

**know this: you have cum early.**

**For those who feel they’ve missed earlier waves—**

**that the tides of value have risen beyond reach,**

**that the sacred tithing required for ascension**

**has already swept past—**

**Know this:**

**The sea is still singing.**

**The wave still curls.**

**And you may still ride.**

**And the portal opens wide when you ride.**

**Now your time has cum to ride the wave to**

**The ever-expanding Archipeligooch.**
